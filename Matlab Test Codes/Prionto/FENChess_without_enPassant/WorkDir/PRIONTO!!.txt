The first function to be used is 

>> calibrate_sample();

then a file named "calib_data.mat" will be created in the work directory
you have to use "calibrate_sample()" at least once before other stuff

now run

>> get_board(1)

this returns the matrix of the first board and shows the detected image

Your job is to run "get_board(i)" sequentially until the game ends 
and then convert the whole game to a "fen" format
